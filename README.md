* __Notifications__ - get a direct message in Mattermost when someone mentions you, requests your review, comments on or modifies one of your merge requests/issues, or assigns you on GitLab
* __Sidebar buttons__ - stay up-to-date with how many reviews, unread messages, assignments and open merge requests you have with buttons in the Mattermost sidebar
* __Slash commands__ - interact with the GitLab plugin using the `/gitlab` slash command
    * __Subscribe to a respository__ - Use `/gitlab subscribe` to subscribe a Mattermost channel to receive posts for new merge requests and/or issues in a GitLab repository
    * __Get to do items__ - Use `/gitlab todo` to get an ephemeral message with items to do in GitLab
    * __Update settings__ - Use `/gitlab settings` to update your settings for the plugin
    * __And more!__ - Run `/gitlab help` to see what else the slash command can do
