## Feature summary of GitLab to Mattermost notifications

### Channel subscriptions

Notify your team of the latest updates by sending notifications from your GitLab group or repository to Mattermost channels. When team members log in the first time to Mattermost each day, they can get a post letting them know what issues and merge requests need their attention. They can also get a refresh of new events by selecting **Refresh** from every webhook configured in GitLab.

You can specify which events trigger a notification. They can see:

- issues - includes new and closed issues
- merges - includes new and closed merge requests
- pushes - includes pushes
- issue_comments - includes new issue comments
- merge_request_comments - include new merge-request comments
- pipeline - include pipeline
- tag - include tag creation
- pull_reviews - includes merge request reviews
- label:"<labelname>" - must include "merges" or "issues" in feature list when using a label
- Defaults to "merges,issues,tag"

### Personal notifications: GitLab bot

Each user in Mattermost is connected with their own personal GitLab account. Users can get a direct message in Mattermost when someone mentions them, requests their review, comments on, or modifies one of their merge requests/issues, or assigns them on GitLab.

### Sidebar buttons

Team members can stay up-to-date with how many reviews, todos, assigned issues, and assigned merge requests they have by using buttons in the Mattermost sidebar.

### Releasing new versions

The version of a plugin is determined at compile time, automatically populating a `version` field in the [plugin manifest](plugin.json):
* If the current commit matches a tag, the version will match after stripping any leading `v`, e.g. `1.3.1`.
* Otherwise, the version will combine the nearest tag with `git rev-parse --short HEAD`, e.g. `1.3.1+d06e53e1`.
* If there is no version tag, an empty version will be combined with the short hash, e.g. `0.0.0+76081421`.

To disable this behaviour, manually populate and maintain the `version` field.
