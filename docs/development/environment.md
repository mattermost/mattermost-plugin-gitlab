# Environment

## Development

This plugin contains both a server and web app component.

Use `make dist` to build distributions of the plugin that you can upload to a Mattermost server. 

Use `make check-style` to check the style. 

Use `make deploy` to deploy the plugin to your local server. Before running `make deploy` you need to set a few environment variables:

```
export MM_SERVICESETTINGS_SITEURL=http://localhost:8065
export MM_ADMIN_USERNAME=admin
export MM_ADMIN_PASSWORD=password
```
