# Updating the Plugin

When a new version of the plugin is released to the **Plugin Marketplace**, the system will display a prompt asking you to update your current version of the GitLab plugin to the newest one. There may be a warning shown if there is a major version change that **may** affect the installation. Generally, updates are seamless and don't interrupt the user experience in Mattermost.
