# Installation

### Release Dependency

* The GitLab plugin is included in the Plugin Marketplace in Mattermost v5.16 and above.
* For Mattermost v5.13 and earlier a manual install is necessary.

### Marketplace Installation

1. Go to **Main Menu &gt; Plugin Marketplace** in Mattermost.
2. Search for "gitlab" or manually find the plugin from the list and click **Install**.
3. After the plugin has downloaded and been installed, click the **Configure** button.

### Manual Installation

If your server doesn't have access to the internet, you can download the latest [plugin binary release](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-gitlab/releases) and upload it to your server via **System Console > Plugins &gt; Plugin Management**. The releases on this page are the same used by the Marketplace. 

See [documentation](https://docs.mattermost.com/administration/plugins.html#set-up-guide) for more details.

See [GitLab plugin release page](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-gitlab/releases) for compatibility considerations.
